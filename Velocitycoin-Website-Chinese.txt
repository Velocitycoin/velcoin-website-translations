The Digital Era Currency. The Speed is BLAZINGLY FAST! The Direction is - TOWARDS SUCCESS!

Launched at the end of 2013 in preparation for what may well be the year to change it all. 2014, the year of Velocity Coin!
Quick Block Times

Quick
30 Second Block Times.A super fast block time, but with enough time for block security....

Fast Transactions
5 Confirmations for Transactions. Meaning your transactions will be fully confirmed & completed in 2.5 Minutes or less!..

Secure Chain
50 Blocks for Mining Confirmation. Fast enough to be convenient for all those hard working miners, but still enough to secure the block chain!.

ASIC and SHA256 Resistant
Velocitcoin is resistant to ASIC and SHA256 flash mining. 62 Million Coins Total.The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything!

Launched at the end of 2013 in preparation for what may well be the Year to change it all. 2014, the year of Velocity Coin!
Velocitycoin is GPU and ASIC resistant using the unique combination of hashing and mixing functions known as Srcypt Jane offering protection against mining farms. So not only does Scrypt-Jane offer a far greater network security, mining efficiency, ASIC resistance and protection. Is it just out right unique. Resistance against ASIC and GPU farms allows CPU and GPU mining, resulting in a network that available for all users.

About
Launched at the end of 2013 in preparation for what may well be the Year to change it all. 2014, the year of Velocity Coin!

Velocitycoin is a alternate cryptocurrency that offers quick block times, confirmations and network security. Velocitycoin is a Scrypt Jane Hybrid, with many features being added consistently.  Unlike many Scrypt and SHA256 coins, Scrypt Jane is a modern twist on the traditional Scrypt mining using a combination of 3 mixing functions and 7 hashing functions. Unlike Scrypt which uses Sha256, Scypt Jane offers several fast and secure alternate hashing functions.
  
 Scrypt-Jane uses an N-Factor (N, 1, 1), that number determines the amount of memory required to solve a share. This N-Factor number will increase over time, usually at regular intervals in the blockchain. As the N-Factor number increases, the mining efficiency will become lower, as the amount of memory needed for each share is increased. The current N-Factor can be shown by typing getmininginfo into the console. This also displays the current amount of memory needed.

Scypt-Jane was  intended to be mined on CPU’s only though that was soon eroded by custom GPU miners. Though these miners are an advantage in the beginning, they soon become less effective as the N-Factor increases, increasing memory making GPU mining less efficient.
 
So not only does Scrypt-Jane offer a far greater network security, mining efficiency, ASIC resistance and protection. Is it just out right unique. Resistance against ASIC and GPU farms allows CPU and GPU mining, resulting in a network that available for all users
